# Dustin Chang's dotfiles

This repo contians my personal dotfiles.

## Zsh

For my Zsh setup, I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), and iTerm2 for my terminal application. The colors are customized for iTerm2 and can be grabbed from the **_.plist_** files (_Will update later to have those colors in there own separate files for straight importing into iTerm2, your welcome to just grab the colors out of the files yourself though_).


## Bash

For my .bash_profile, it is partly based on [Catalin Maris](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)'s dotfiles.
