# Dustin Chang's dotfiles

This repo contians my personal dotfiles.

## Zsh

For my Zsh setup, I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), and [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for my terminal application.

The colors are customized for iTerm2, and can be added by simply importing [raijin.itermcolors](https://github.com/dustinchang/dot_files/blob/master/zsh_themes/raijin.itermcolors) into iTerm2.

To _import_ into iTerm2, go to _iTerm->Preferences->Colors Tab->Load Presets->Import..._ and then select the **_raijin.itermcolors_** file. Then once imported, just select the _raijin_ color scheme.

Here is a screenshot of my terminal:

## Bash

For my .bash_profile, it is partly based on [Catalin Maris](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)'s dotfiles.

## Editor setups

The [editor_setup.txt](https://github.com/dustinchang/dot_files/blob/master/editor_setup.txt) file contains my usual setup with all the packages, keybindings, and snippets that I use within [Atom](https://atom.io/) & [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

##### Vim

This repo also contains my Vim setup. I use [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) as my package manager for it, and then my customizations are mostly at the bottom of the file, besides all my custom plugins added.
